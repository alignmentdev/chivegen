HOW TO USE CHIVEGEN (v0.2.12)
A work in progress.
  
INPUT DIRECTORY
At bare minimum, you will need one input directory, with the following:
	- A template.html file, which will be your standard page template for all pages of the archive. This should either have a <style> section for in-page CSS, or link your site stylesheet.
	- A folder for each story you want in your archive
		- For each chapter, a file called "ch###.txt", where "###" is the chapter number, e.g. "ch001.txt", "ch002.txt", etc.
For a better functioning, nicer archive, you should also add:
	- In story folders:
		- A file called "storyinfo.txt", with information about the story in question (see STORYINFO.TXT - RECOGNIZED FIELDS)
		- Optionally, a file called "toc.txt" with the titles of the story's chapters. You do not need to number the titles. They will be applied in order automatically.
	- A file "index.txt", which contains the text of your homepage. (News, stats widgets, etc.)
	- A file "config.txt", for any settings you want to apply every time you generate your archive.
For some customization of your site's style, you may also want to add other templating files to the root of your input directory, as specified under "INPUT FILENAMES FOR CUSTOM TEMPLATES."

CASUAL HTML AND HOW TO USE IT

Casual HTML basically fills in line break and paragraph tags for you, but leaves any existing HTML alone.

So for example, this:

	Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Adipiscing <i>elit</i>, lorem ipsum?

	Lorem ipsum
	Dolor sit amet

Becomes:

	<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Adipiscing <i>elit</i>, lorem ipsum?</p>

	<p>Lorem ipsum<br>
	Dolor sit amet</p>

It also detects lines that begin either with paragraph tags, or with certain non-paragraph tags such as <div> and <img>, and does not put unnecessary paragraph tags around them.

The full list of starting strings that will prevent automatic formatting is: "<br", "<hr", "<h", "</", "<di", "<im", "<if", "<bl", "<li", "<ol", "<ul", "<ta", "<tr", "<td", "<th", and "<no". The last entry, "<no>", is meant to serve as a catchall for "don't format this".
