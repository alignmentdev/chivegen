CHANGELOG
	
	2022 May 25
		- Moved changelog and to-do list to a separate file.
		- Now on version 0.2.5
		- Removed regex import as it was no longer needed.
		- Added pagination! Complete with customizable maximum items per page.
		- Changed by_author, by_fandom, to be indexes of authors and fandoms,
		  and added "authors" and "fandoms" subfolders to have all works under
		  each author/fandom
		- Changed the formatting of toSafeURL()'s output to ensure that tag pages
		  have unique urls when paginated. Unsafe chars are now replaced with "_##"
		  (where ## = int value of the char), and the pagination is appended at
		  the end as "_#" (# = pagenumber), so they can't accidentally overwrite
		  one another.
	
	2022 May 24
		- Better commenting on the numberWithCommas() method
		- Replaced the toSafeURL() function with a much faster version that
		  uses a StringBuilder and char int values instead of regex. The new
		  function is literally about 30x faster than the first attempt. Phew!
		- Replaced String concatenation in the readFileToString(), convertToHTML()
		  and insertIntoTemplate() functions with StringBuilder append, which
		  seems to reduce total running time by about 30%. 
		  (Average ~700ms -> ~450ms for the original public domain demo.)
		- Added Frankenstein and Dracula's first several chapters to the demo input.
		- Implemented tags!!
		- Added generation of tag pages in a designated "tags" folder in output.
		- Broke the authors index navigation. Oops.
		- Fixed authors/title/etc index navigation, and modified it to not
		  generate a nav section if not needed.
	
	2022 May 23
		- Now on version 0.2.4
		- Revamped the Casual HTML parser to work for an entire text block
		  instead of line by line, so it can distinguish between paragraph
		  and line breaks. It also now uses a HashSet to check for HTML tags
		  instead of a dozen string comparisons.
		- Removed command line arguments for changing field labels. These can
		  just be read from file, and were clogging up the options list.
		- Began work on a system for subgrouping on index pages, currently not
		  implemented.
		- Added a {ListingTitle} field to the work index template.
		- Added a (very bad) function to convert potentially unsafe strings into
		  viable URLs/folder names.
	
	2022 May 22
		- Added authorLabel and getAuthorLabel() for works not using a byline
		- Replaced getField(label, content) and getSummaryField(label, content) 
		  with a single getField() method that takes the field as the first argument,
		  then the label and content, for better reusability.
		- Fixed bug where hasDateUpdated and hasDatePublished had been accidentally swapped
		  in Story's code for re-converting the dates to strings for display
		- Added a hashset and array for tags in Story.java, and a hashset for the 
		  general tagset in FicArchiveBuilder as well
		- Moved story output folders to a subfolder "stories" in the output folder
		- Added a "by author" index and SortStoryBy + Comparator, plus AuthorNumber
		  (and getTotalAuthors() to calculate it) in the site stats widgets.
		- Added comma formatting to the wordcounts on infoboxes
		- Added Poe's 'The Raven' and 'The Cask of Amontillado' to the demo input.
	
	2022 May 21
		- Now on version 0.2.3
		- Moved the parsing of command line arguments to a separate method, parseArgs()
		- Added code to copy CSS stylesheets to output directory
		- Added an "Author" field and optiona byLine template (currently not tested yet)
		- Added Fandom and Story Title comparators and associated objects (SortStoryBy + children)
		- Added buildIndexSortedBy() method, which generates an index of all works, sorted
		  by the given SortStoryBy object's parameters.
		- Added options to skip any and all of these indices
		- Main now creates a separate homepage, with optional site stats
		- Added option to ignore a leading "The" in titles and fandom names when sorting
		- Added LocalDate objects to Story.java for date comparison
		- Added DateUpdated comparator (which sorts reverse chronologically) and a by_latest.html
		  index.
	
	2022 May 20
		- Added site path option for URL prefacing when generating links
		- Added 'skip empty fields' option
	
	2022 May 19
		- Began changelog
		- Fixed a bug where Story.java's storyInfo String is never actually
		  filled out, causing the infobox to be rebuilt every time getStoryInfo()
		  is called.
		- Changed "storydata.txt" to "storyinfo.txt"
		- Added completion status to standard infobox (keywords, pagebuilding)
		- Created buildSummaryField(String, String) and  buildField(String, String) 
		  methods for Story.java to quickly assemble fields using field and summary 
		  templates, so the fields can be given further custom formatting, and empty
		  fields can be skipped.
		- Added template file inputs for summaries/notes and fields (summaries.txt, fields.txt)
		- Added customizable labels for all major fields
		- Added commandline arguments for field customization, and the option of
		  reading in field labels from an input file (labels.txt)
